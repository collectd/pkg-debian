_Description: Layout of RRD files has changed
 The layout of the RRD files created by collectd has changed significantly
 since version 3.x. In order to keep your old data you have to migrate it.
 This can be done by using /usr/lib/collectd/utils/migrate-3-4.px.
 .
 This step requires both the perl and the rrdtool packages to be installed,
 which is currently not the case. You need to perform the migration manually.

_Description: Remove all collected data (e.g. RRD files)?
