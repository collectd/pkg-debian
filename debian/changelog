collectd (4.7.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    New plugins:
    - Connection tracking table size: conntrack
    - Linux file-system based caching framework statistics: fscache
    - Receive and interpret Ganglia multicast traffic: gmond (disabled in
      Debian, libganglia >= 3 is required)

    - Information about network protocols: protocols
    - Parse table-like structured files: table
    - Power consumption measurements from "The Energy Detective" (TED): ted

  * debian/rules:
    - Install collectd-unixsock.py to /usr/share/doc/collectd/examples/.
    - Pass CPPFLAGS and CFLAGS as arguments to configure instead of setting
      them in the environment - this is the recommended way.
    - Pass appropriate JAVAC, JAVA_CPPFLAGS and JAVA_LDFLAGS variables to
      configure, using OpenJDK found in /usr/lib/jvm/java-6-openjdk. The
      archdir mapping used by the openjdk-6 Debian package is used to find
      libjvm.so in JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/ARCHDIR/server.
    - Pass --enable-all-plugins to configure to make sure that the build fails
      if any prerequisites are missing.
  * debian/control:
    - Build-depend on openjdk-6-jdk.
  * debian/collectd.install:
    - Install collectd-java.5.

      Schrijver for reporting this (Closes: #524593).
  * debian/control:
    - Build-depend on iptables-dev (>= 1.4.3.2-2) to link against the packaged
      libiptc which is available as shared library since iptables 1.4.3.

collectd (4.4.2-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Removed the work around for #474087 (broken openipmi .pc files) introduced
    in 4.4.1-1 and instead build depend on libopenipmi-dev (>= 2.0.14-1~)
    which includes fixed .pc files. This fixes an undefined symbol error when
    loading the ipmi plugin caused by that work around (Closes: #494665).
  * debian/collectd.init.d:
    - The "status" command now exits with 1 if collectd is not running.
    - Do not suppress output when checking the configuration with the -t
      command line option. This will also show errors that don't cause
      collectd to abort, e.g. failure to load plugins (Closes: #499232).
  * debian/control:
    - Added librrd-dev as the preferred option to the librrd2-dev build
      dependency - the latter one is a virtual package since rrdtool 1.3.
  * Added debian/patches/perl_deadlock.dpatch - upstream patch to fix a
    possible deadlock in the perl plugin (Closes: #499179).
  * Added debian/patches/memory_libstatgrab.dpatch - trivial upstream patch to

    fix a possible memory leak.
  * Added debian/patches/snmp_memleak.dpatch - trivial upstream patch to fix a
    possible memory leak in the snmp plugin.
  * Added debian/patches/memcached_fdleak.dpatch - trivial upstream patch to
    fix a possible file descriptor leak in the memcached plugin.
  * Added debian/patches/memcached_timeout.dpatch - trivial upstream patch to
    fix the timeout passed to poll(2).

collectd (4.4.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Removed librrd0-dev and libmysqlclient14-dev from the build-dependencies -
    those package are no longer available since Etch.
  * Removed byacc from the build-dependencies - collectd now requires bison.
  * Removed libupsclient-config.sh - upstream now supports pkg-config for
    libupsclient.
  * Include collection3 in /usr/share/doc/collectd/examples/:
    - Updated README.Debian to point the collection3's README.
    - Added libconfig-general-perl to the suggested packages.
  * README.Debian: Added a note about how to get collectd2html.pl working with
    version 4 of collectd.
  * Added debian/patches/myplugin_strcpy.dpatch - use sstrncpy() instead of
    strcpy() which is poisoned in collectd.h.
  * collectd.overrides: Removed shlib-with-non-pic-code for nut.so - the
    plugin now links against the shared libupsclient.
  * Do not compress any example files, so they may be used directly.

 -- Sebastian Harl <sh@tokkee.org>  Fri, 25 Jul 2008 19:58:58 +0200

collectd (4.4.1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Restrict libcurl4-gnutls-dev build dependency to versions which are not
    affected by #488701 (Closes: #489091).
  * Added linux-libc-dev (<< 2.6.25-1) as an option to the linux-libc-dev
    (>= 2.6.25-4) build dependency - those versions are not affected by
    #479899.
  * Added build dependency on pkg-config - this is used by collectd's
    configure script to check for a couple of libraries.
  * Added libupsclient-config.sh to imitate libupsclient-config which is no
    longer available. libupsclient-config.sh is a simple wrapper around
    pkg-config. This is a workaround until upstream supports pkg-config for
    libupsclient.
  * Replaced nut-dev build dependency with libupsclient1-dev:
    Reenabled the "nut" plugin on all architectures.

    - Added the plugin to collectd.conf.
    - Added /usr/share/doc/collectd/examples/iptables/.
    - Added build dependency on linux-libc-dev (>= 2.6.25-4) - that version is
      required because of #479899.
  * New debconf template translations:
    - gl.po, thanks to Jacobo Tarrio (Closes: #482667).
  * Added a work around for #474087 (broken openipmi .pc files) by forcing the
    inclusion of the ipmi plugin and manually specifying the dependencies.
  * Updated standards-version to 3.8.0 (no changes).

  * Disabled iptables plugin - libiptc is no longer available in Debian.
    - Removed the plugin from collectd.conf.
    - Removed /usr/share/doc/collectd/examples/iptables/.

    i386 and powerpc (libvirt is only available on those architectures).

    sure Xen is supported and to fix some strange FTBFS complaining about a

  * Updated package description to mention the monitoring support.
  * Install liboping/oping.h to collectd-dev as well.
  * collectd.init.d: Optionally start collectdmon to monitor collectd. This
    can be configured using the USE_COLLECTDMON variable - enabled by default.
  * collectd.init.d: Added ENABLE_COREFILES option - if enabled the core file
    limit will be set to unlimited - disabled by default.
  * Compile collectd with -DLT_LAZY_OR_NOW='RTLD_LAZY|RTLD_GLOBAL' to force
    lt_dlopen() to use the RTLD_GLOBAL flag which is required by the perl

collectd (3.10.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.

    - APC UPS's charge, load, input/output/battery voltage, etc.: apcups
    - NTP daemon's local clock drift, offset to peers, etc.: ntpd
  * Upstream no longer provides a debian/ directory. Thus no repackaging is
    required any longer.
  * Not using getifaddrs() is now the default in upstream. getifaddrs.dpatch
    no longer needed.
  * Added collectd-hddtemp as a suggestion to the collectd package.

collectd (3.9.4+debian-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Initial release (Closes: #373008).
  * Removed upstream's debian/ directory from .orig.tar.gz.
  * getifaddrs.dpatch: Patching src/traffic.c to read data from /proc instead

    AMD64.
