  * Compile collectd with -DLT_LAZY_OR_NOW='RTLD_LAZY|RTLD_GLOBAL' to force
    lt_dlopen() to use the RTLD_GLOBAL flag which is required by the perl
    plugin (which would otherwise be unable to find symbols defined in libperl
    when loading perl modules that require such symbols).
  * Disable debugging support.
  * watch file: Added uversionmangle for "beta" and "-rc".
  * Override "spelling-error-in-description" for the mysql plugin name - all
    plugins are spelled lowercase.
